It functions through an RNA product, which binds lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and serves as a scaffold to assemble these regulators at the HOXD gene cluster, thereby promoting epigenetic repression of HOXD. This gene is highly expressed in multiple tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.
347689	This gene produces alternatively spliced long non-coding RNAs. These RNAs were observed to be upregulated in tumor cells and positively correlated to expression of the SRY-box 2 gene. Overexpression of these transcripts may promote cell proliferation.
645323	This is an evolutionarily conserved gene that produces alternatively spliced long non-coding RNAs that may be expressed predominantly in the brain and visual cortex.

7503	X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

10984	Human chromosomal region 11p15.5 contains two clusters of epigenetically-regulated genes that are expressed from only one chromosome in a parent-of-origin manner. Each cluster, or imprinted domain, is regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control region (ICR). The human CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 domain is regulated by an ICR located in an intron of KCNQ1, and contains at least eight genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially from the maternally-inherited allele. The DNA of the ICR is specifically methylated on the maternally-inherited chromosome, and unmethylated on the paternally-inherited chromosome. The ICR contains the promoter of the KCNQ1OT1 gene that is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele. The KCNQ1OT1 transcript is the antisense to the KCNQ1 gene and is a unspliced long non-coding RNA. It interacts with chromatin and regulates transcription of multiple target genes through epigenetic modifications. The transcript is abnormally expressed from both chromosomes in most patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the transcript also plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis.

10984	Human chromosomal region 11p15.5 contains two clusters of epigenetically-regulated genes that are expressed from only one chromosome in a parent-of-origin manner. Each cluster, or imprinted domain, is regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control region (ICR). The human CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 domain is regulated by an ICR located in an intron of KCNQ1, and contains at least eight genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially from the maternally-inherited allele. The DNA of the ICR is specifically methylated on the maternally-inherited chromosome, and unmethylated on the paternally-inherited chromosome. The ICR contains the promoter of the KCNQ1OT1 gene that is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele. The KCNQ1OT1 transcript is the antisense to the KCNQ1 gene and is a unspliced long non-coding RNA. It interacts with chromatin and regulates transcription of multiple target genes through epigenetic modifications. The transcript is abnormally expressed from both chromosomes in most patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the transcript also plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis.
7503	X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome, and is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. The transcript is a spliced RNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X inactivation.

Its upregulation in multiple cancerous tissues has been associated with the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.

100499467	This gene produces a long non-protein coding RNA that is involved in the regulation of gene expression during tumor progression. This transcript can promote cell proliferation in gastric cancer through interaction with enhancer of zeste 2 and other epigenetic suppressors of gene expression, thereby downregulating target genes including Kruppel like factors 2 and 4. This transcript may also act as a tumor suppressor by promoting interaction between protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (Ptpn11) and ubiquitin ligase, resulting in degradation of Ptpn11 and lowered oncogenic signalling. Naturally-occurring variation at this locus results in the formation of a binding site for miR-1231, which negatively regulates activity of this transcript. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
100124700	This gene is located within the Homeobox C (HOXC) gene cluster on chromosome 12 and is co-expressed with the HOXC genes. It functions through an RNA product, which binds lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and serves as a scaffold to assemble these regulators at the HOXD gene cluster, thereby promoting epigenetic repression of HOXD. This gene is highly expressed in multiple tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.
50652	This gene produces a spliced, long non-coding RNA that is highly overexpressed in most types of prostate cancer cells and is used as a specific biomarker for this type of cancer. This gene is embedded in an intronic region of the prune2 gene on the opposite DNA strand. The transcript regulates prune2 levels through formation of a double-stranded RNA that undergoes adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-dependent adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. In prostate cancer derived cells, overexpression of PCA induced downregulation of prune2, leading to decreased cell proliferation. Conversely, silencing in prostate cancer cells resulted in increased proliferation. Regulation of this gene appears to be sensitive to androgen-receptor activation, a molecular signature of prostate cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

8847	This locus represents a microRNA host gene and also produces long alternatively spliced non-coding RNAs. This genome region was observed to be deleted or epigenetically suppressed in leukemia, and was implicated as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. However, an alternative transcript produced at this locus was also found to promote progression through the cell cycle via angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 and cyclin D1.
