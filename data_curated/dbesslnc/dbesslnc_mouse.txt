Mouse	This gene encodes a spliced long non-coding RNA transcribed from a bidirectional promoter shared with Foxf1 on the opposite strand. The encoded transcript is essential for normal development of the heart and body wall. It is thought to act by binding to polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and/or TrxG/MLL complexes to promote the methylation of the promoters of target genes, thus reducing their expression. It plays a role in cell fate determination in tissues derived from the lateral plate mesoderm. Knockout models reveal loss of this gene is lethal in mice.

Mouse	X inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females. The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X inactivation center (XIC). The XIC comprises several non-coding and protein-coding genes, and this gene was the first non-coding gene identified within the XIC. This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome. It is essential for the initiation and spread of X-inactivation. It silences hundreds of genes by recruiting and tethering repressive chromatin-modifying complexes to the inactive X chromosome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.
